Namma Yatri Application - Business Problem Solving with SQL and Power BI Dashboard


Introduction
Welcome to the Namma Yatri Application Business Problem Solving project!
In this repository, we showcase our journey of tackling business problems faced by Namma Yatri, a leading transportation service provider,
using SQL in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and creating an interactive visualization dashboard using Power BI.


Project Overview
Namma Yatri is committed to providing efficient and reliable transportation services to its customers. To optimize operations and enhance customer experience, we took on the challenge of solving several business problems:


Route Optimization: Identifying the most efficient routes for different vehicles.
Customer Segmentation: Understanding customer demographics and preferences.
Performance Metrics: Tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) for the organization.
We tackled these problems using SQL to analyze and extract insights from Namma Yatri's data and created an intuitive Power BI dashboard for data visualization.


Data Sources
To address these challenges, we utilized various data sources, including:

Customer Data: Information about Namma Yatri's customers, such as demographics, booking history, and feedback.
Route Data: Data related to different routes, including distances, stops, and schedules.
Performance Metrics: KPIs, such as on-time performance, vehicle utilization, and revenue data.


SQL Solution
In this section, we provide an overview of how we utilized SQL in Microsoft SSMS to solve the business problems:

Route Optimization: We wrote SQL queries to analyze historical route data, identifying congestion points, and suggesting optimized routes for vehicles.
Customer Segmentation: We performed customer segmentation based on demographics, booking behavior, and feedback using SQL queries to gain insights into customer preferences.
Performance Metrics: We calculated and monitored key performance metrics, such as on-time performance and revenue, through SQL queries and stored procedures.


Power BI Dashboard
To make the insights accessible and actionable, we created an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The dashboard offers a user-friendly interface with various visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to provide a holistic view of Namma Yatri's performance.
